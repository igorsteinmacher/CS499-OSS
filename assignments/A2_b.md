## Assignment Overview
In this module, we are learning Git and GitHub. In this assignment, you will need to both link a local repo with a remote GitHub repo and create a repo on GitHub and clone it into your machine.

### Goals
Learn about Open Source practices.

### Procedure
* Step 1. We will use the same git repository created on assignment A-2.1 (handson). If you have removed that folder from your machine, do not worry, download the file handson.zip Download handson.zip, unzip it and, using the command line, access the "handson/" directory. 
* Step 2. Create a new repository under your username on GitHub called handson. (http://github.com/<yourusername>/handson)
* Step 3. Add your created github repo as the remote in the local machine (See GitHub docsLinks to an external site.)
* Step 4. Make a  push to the remote repository (See GitHub docsLinks to an external site.)

 *** BE AWARE: You may face authentication problems... Searching for the solution is part of the assignment

### What to submit?
Submit the URL of your repository and a screenshot of the result of git remote -v on your machine
