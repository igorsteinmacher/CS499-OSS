**Report**
The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written by Eric Raymond in 1997 and continuously updated till 2000. The premise of the book is that Raymond leads a successful open-source project, fetchmail and provides lessons he learned throughout the process. He also discusses his theories of two different development styles, the "Cathedral" and the “Bazaar”. The overall purpose of the book is to show which of the two approaches is more productive and what the future of software development might look like.
