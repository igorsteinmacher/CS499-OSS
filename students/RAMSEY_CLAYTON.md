-Summary: Since random number generator are essential to generate secret keys, this paper uses SRAM device and uses its large grid of cells to generate highly ranom number. They use pre-aging attribute which affects the cells of the SRAM by increasing its randomness and they designed circuits which is used for true random number generation.
