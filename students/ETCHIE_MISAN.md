## Summary

This book by Nadia Eghbal explores the dynamics of open source software development, focusing on how modern open source projects operate in public spaces like GitHub. The work examines the challenges and opportunities that come with building software in the open, including community management, sustainability, and the economics of open source development.

The book discusses how open source has evolved from its early days to become a cornerstone of modern software development, with many projects now operating as public goods maintained by communities of contributors. Eghbal addresses key issues such as:

- The role of maintainers in open source projects
- The challenges of sustaining open source projects long-term
- The relationship between open source communities and their corporate sponsors
- How open source projects handle growth and scale
- The psychological and social dynamics of working in public spaces

This work is particularly relevant to understanding the open source ecosystem and the various roles participants can take in contributing to and maintaining open source projects.
